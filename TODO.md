# Todo

A running list of things todo to keep me on track ...

- [ ] build prototype registration api (HTTP)
- [ ] decide on database
- [ ] use database to store auths

- [ ] set up RabbitMQ
- [ ] add RabbitMQ topic creation to registration procedure

- [ ] design format for data exchange between gateways and core (GraphQL-like?)
