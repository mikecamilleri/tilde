# NOTES

## TODO

- [ ] reconceptualize with MongoDB as database
- [ ] write schemas for user API and MongoDB using [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org)

... or just store the entire system state as a big object in memory and persist it to disk every so often. Do this within one of the already defined services or make it a service itself? Storage of historical feature settings and readings would be handled separately.
